# 3Dprinter
This is repository for MakersLab 3D printer which would be more precise than common 3D printer for fff technology. 
Also we are planning to add bigger printing volume, than common 20x20x20cm.

directory STL contains all stl parts to be printed for complete printer.

in directory source you can find all parts in source files not converted to stl
